Due to my poor time management I did not manage to complete quite a lot of things and
I will list them here so you don't have to look for something that is not implemented

Poor credential management, should have used ENV variables for example
Screenshot/video capture on test failure is not functional
Not every Pylint warning is fixed
On Jitsi meet test I tried using OBS Virtual camera for custom video feed, but for some reason
could not select the OBS Virtual camera option in Jitsi meet app
Docstrings are missing for methods
